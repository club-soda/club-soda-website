<h2><strong>LONG TERM BENEFITS OF A SOBER SPRINT
</strong></h2>
<p dir=""ltr"">Our first ever MOB/Sober Sprint programme took place in October 2015. Six months later (May 2016) we asked people from the first programme how they were doing now, half a year after their sober month. Everyone who responded said they were drinking less than they did before (most said they were drinking “much less”), and that their health and general wellbeing were also better. Some had lower blood pressure and had lost weight. Here are quotes from two members showing the benefits you can get from completing the programme:</p>

<blockquote>
<p dir=""ltr""><em>Before the MOB I’d done a couple of months of counting units and sticking within the government’s old guidelines for men but it felt a struggle and it wasn’t clear that I would be able to stick at it. Now I don’t notice anymore that I don’t drink at home and can pace myself when out on ordinary evenings out. I sleep much better and have much better skin but I haven’t lost weight and haven’t managed to shake off a cold any better than before.</em></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><em>I have now been sober for 32 days. My blood pressure has normalized and I sleep better and I have lost 10 lbs. Thanks.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h2><strong>DOING A DRY JANUARY, GOING SOBER FOR OCTOBER?</strong></h2>
<p dir=""ltr"">A Sober Sprint is excellent additional support if you are doing a sober month for charity, and feel like you are finding it difficult. The Sober Sprint programme will take you through your dry month (whether January or any other month!), what you might be feeling at the start, halfway through, and towards the end of your challenge. And we will give you many tools and tips to help you successfully reach your goals.</p>

<p class=""page-title"">Mindful drinking is an 8 week online course helping you achieve your drinking goals, whether you want to cut down, stop for a bit, or quit alcohol for good. Here are just two quotes from the nearly 400 Club Soda members who have completed the course and reduced their drinking:</p>

</header>
<div class=""entry-content clearfix"">

<em>I met my goals with the occasional excess but felt in control and that I can maintain my goals each week. Looking forward I think I can reduce further. John</em>

<em>I wasn’t sure I was able to cut down, and am very pleased that I can and I have. Stell</em>
<h2><strong>CUT DOWN OR QUIT ALCOHOL – IT IS ALL ABOUT MINDFUL DRINKING</strong></h2>
This mindful drinking course is aimed at people who want to change their alcohol habits. You may be drinking a few glasses of wine every day, or binge at weekends. Either way, if you feel that your alcohol consumption is higher than you’d like it to be, this course will help you to quit or moderate. Note that this course is not recommended for physically dependent drinkers.
<h2><strong>BASED ON BEHAVIOUR CHANGE SCIENCE</strong></h2>
Powered by behaviour change science, the mindful drinking course will give you all the tools and techniques that you need to change your drinking habits. It includes 4 weeks of stimulating and practical emails that will help you understand your drinking and how you can go about changing your relationship with alcohol, followed by another 4 weeks of practice and email revision along with prompts to consolidate your hard work. As part of this course you will become part of the Club Soda community. A group of like-minded individuals changing their drinking together and boosting your chances of success.

<h2><strong>WHAT PEOPLE HAVE SAID ABOUT MINDFUL DRINKING</strong></h2>
<em>Club Soda has been an enormous support for me during the last 4 weeks. I have looked forward to the emails &amp; it has been uncanny how they seem to be exactly relevant to my experience. Karen</em>

<em>The emails have helped me think about my habits / lifestyle so very much. I am trying to cut down but have just had a weekend away skiing where I failed miserably on a successful day. I only half believe in myself but I am loving the emails each day and will probably sign up again. The triggers have been the most insightful. Thank you for your help. I am not a lost cause yet! Louise</em>

<em>I am much more aware of my drinking habits/triggers &amp; behaviors since doing this course. I plan to continue to use the tools provided in the course to moderate my drinking and potentially even stop altogether as I start to accept I don’t ‘need’ to drink. Gill</em>

Eating: This walk isn’t blessed with many options along the way. You may want to bring sandwiches and we’ll find somewhere to stop and eat.

Terrain: Mostly flat, metalled pathways.

This is a nature ramble of a walk, rich with tree spotting opportunities. We will join the Dollis Brook vale shortly after leaving High Barnet, and walk south through Totteridge, Woodside Park, and West Finchley, and see another side to suburban London. Skirting Finchley golf course, we’ll take in John Fowler’s Mill Hill Viaduct before turning eastwards at Hendon, joining Mutton Brook, which we will follow to Hampstead. From there you can either head up to East Finchley tube station, or continue onto Hampstead Heath, and leave via Hampstead tube.

<span style=""font-weight: 400"">Your rational mind wants the great beach body, but your emotional mind wants the cookie, or glass (or more) of wine.
